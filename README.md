# SAR_BAL
Batch active learning for SAR data

## Dependencies
graphlearning
annoy

## Refactoring progress

### Need to do
    - BAL_Experiments
    - K_Means_Batch_AL

### Runs but not correct
    - Local Max Batch Theory   refer to the file for exact changes. I might just get rid of this

### Only syntax left. Should also just check again

    - Batch Examples Plots.ipynb
    - Dijkstras Coreset.ipynb
    - Proof testing.ipynb.  I should remove this




### Done

# CURRENTLY LOOKING AT Accuracy and time test...


# Actual Read Me
This code was created for the paper **cite**. All the results contained in that paper are within this github repo. 

**List out what each file is for**
